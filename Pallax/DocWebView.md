Documentation and UI Review: Addressing Key Issues and Suggestions for Improvement
This document provides a comprehensive review of the current issues with the documentation and the user interface (UI) of the platform, along with recommendations for improvements.

Dashboard Review
Empty States Need Context Several sections, such as Top Tenants, Payment Zones, and Finance Overview, are currently empty.

Suggestion: Introduce helpful messages or tooltips like:
“No data yet – add a tenant to see stats.”
“Rent data will appear after the first billing cycle.” This will provide clarity to users and reduce confusion.
Improve Visual Feedback and Interactivity Most cards on the dashboard are static.

Suggestion: Make KPI cards interactive. For example, clicking on "Vacant Units" could filter the unit list, while donut chart segments could act as filters to drill down into specific data.


Add a Quick Actions Section Currently, there is no quick access to important tasks such as “Add Unit” or “Generate Invoice.”


Suggestion: Introduce a floating action button or shortcut panel with key actions to streamline common tasks.


Enhance the Financial/Expenditure Overview The current financial data is set to zero, which is understandable for new users, but the layout lacks visual indicators such as trends or comparisons.


Suggestion: Use icons (↑↓), small bar indicators, or percentages to show trends or comparisons against the previous period. This would help users get quick insights.


Tenant Insights Are Missing The Top Tenants card is empty and lacks context about the ranking of tenants.


Suggestion: Display tenants ranked by factors such as:


Timeliness of payment.


Length of occupancy.


Units with the highest rental value.


Date Filter Needs Labeling While the date picker is well-positioned, it lacks a clear label, leaving users uncertain of its purpose.


Suggestion: Label the date filter clearly, for example: “Date Range Filter” or “Period Selection” to ensure clarity.


Add More Data Context Although zero values are expected in the early stages, the system could better inform users about what data will appear in each section and how to populate it effectively.


Wording Mismatches between the Site and Documentation There are discrepancies in terminology between the documentation and the live site.


Suggestion: Ensure consistency in terminology between the site and the documentation to avoid confusion.


Logical Flow Mismatch between Documentation and UI Upon review, there is a mismatch between the order of sections in the documentation and the actual UI layout.


Suggestion: Reorder the documentation to follow the natural flow of the dashboard, from top-left to bottom-right, to better match the user journey.



Table of Contents (ToC) Review
Suggestion: The contents in the ToC should be clickable, directing users to the relevant sections. Since users typically refer to the ToC as a guide to navigate the documentation, this will improve accessibility.


Side Note: Consider adding a History section where users can track activities or changes made to their account.



Property Management Review
Property Pathing in URL When a property is clicked, the generated URL path should include the property’s name instead of using numerical codes.


Suggestion: Ensure URLs are descriptive and user-friendly.


Disabling Form Entries Based on Selections Is it possible to disable certain form entries when specific selections are made (e.g., when adding a unit, specifically for a studio apartment)?


Suggestion: Add dynamic form behavior that adjusts based on previous selections to avoid unnecessary input fields.


Search Feature Bug The search function currently fails to display the correct information when valid search values are entered.


Suggestion: Review and fix the search function to ensure accurate results are returned.


Bulk Unit Addition via Excel Clarification is needed on the behavior of the system when not all entries are filled during bulk unit addition using Excel.


Suggestion: Provide clear documentation or error messages when entries are missing.


Unit Assignment Walkthrough A step-by-step guide on how to assign a unit to a tenant is currently missing.


Suggestion: Include a clear, detailed walk-through of the unit assignment process.



Tenant Management Section
Incorrect Total in Tenant List The total displayed in the tenant list appears to be incorrect.


Suggestion: Verify and correct the tenant total calculation to match the data displayed in the list.


Missing Status Section The documentation mentions a status section for tenants, but it is not present in the UI.


Suggestion: Ensure the status section is properly implemented and visible in the UI.


Dropdown Issues The dropdown for selecting agreements has no options available, making it unusable.


Suggestion: Address the dropdown issue to ensure that users can select valid agreements.


Exporting Penalties Exporting penalty data fails to provide the necessary details despite correct start and end date inputs.


Suggestion: Investigate and resolve the issue with exporting penalty data.



Accounting Review
Unnecessary Step in Account Overview When navigating to the account overview, the third step in the process seems unnecessary, as the overview is already the default page when clicking Accounting.


Suggestion: Streamline the navigation by removing the redundant step.


Missing Data for Full Analysis The documentation lacks the necessary data to fully analyze the information available on the site.


Suggestion: Ensure that all relevant data is included in the documentation for clarity.


Dropdown Icons Not Updating The dropdown elements in the Accounting section do not update their icons when selected, which makes it unclear whether a selection was made.


Suggestion: Implement visual feedback for dropdown selections, such as icon changes.



Financial Feed Review
Redundant Step in Financial Feed Navigation Clicking on Financial Feed takes the user directly to live transactions, making the second step of accessing live transactions redundant.


Suggestion: Simplify the navigation by removing the unnecessary second step.


Inconsistent Documentation Flow The documentation lacks a clear chronological flow, making it difficult to follow.


Suggestion: Organize the documentation in a more logical, step-by-step order for better readability.


Word Mismatches in Documentation There is an inconsistency between the terminology used on the site and in the documentation (e.g., Recon Status vs. Reconciliation Status).


Suggestion: Standardize the terms used throughout the documentation.



Expense Cycle Review
Missing Tabs The documentation includes tabs (such as Requisitions and Disbursement) that are not present on the site.


Suggestion: Update the documentation to reflect the actual tabs available on the site.


Inaccurate Location of Expense Statistics The documentation states that the summary of expense-related statistics is at the top of the Expense Accounts tab, but it is actually located at the bottom.


Suggestion: Correct the documentation to accurately reflect the UI layout.


Pagination Issues The pagination system causes confusion as it resets to the first page every time, disrupting the flow.


Suggestion: Maintain continuous pagination so users can easily follow the content.
